This code will create a basic interactive poll widget that allows users to vote and see real-time updates of the poll results. It also displays the user's city and location based on their IP address.

To improve the widget, you could add the following features:

Allow users to create their own polls.
Add more poll options.
Implement user authentication to prevent duplicate votes.
Use a database to store the poll results and user data.
Add a countdown timer to encourage users to vote before the poll closes.
Display the poll results in a more visually appealing way.
